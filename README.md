# Hologram Mod

## Description
Hologram is a mod that uses spheres to go to a 3D models vertices, or in other words, it shows a *rough* 3d model made out of spheres.

## Features
- Toggable and Moveable Hologram
- You can punch it (make a fist) to punch the spheres
- Spin it by holding grip
- Change the model by clicking the buttons
- Ability to upload your own models

## Usage
- Once installed, the hologram should be displayed in gym.
- No additional configuration is needed.

## How to Upload your Own OBJ Files
- Download an obj file (make sure its under 2500 vertices, or else it will lag, so download a simple 3d model, ignore at your own risk.)
- Open it in blender (or any 3D Modeling Software) and make sure to scale it down so it isnt huge. Use the Donut.obj in the UserData Folder for reference. Make sure to account for the amount of vertices so they don't overlap. It may take a bit of tinkering.
- Export the obj file.
- Put the obj file in UserData/Holograms where the Settings.txt file is
- Run the game to see your new model as a hologram!

Have fun!
